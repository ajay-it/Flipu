# Flipu
E-Commerce App (App for consumer)

This project is an ecommerce Android application named "Flipu". It is built using Kotlin programming language and XML for UI design in Android Studio. The app is equipped with all the necessary features required for an ecommerce platform, including user login and authentication using Firebase, local data storage using Room database, and cloud storage using Firebase.

In addition to the user app, this project also includes an admin app for sellers to monitor their products. Sellers can add products to the platform and will be notified when an order is placed. They can then stay in contact with the customer until the product is delivered.

This project is a great example of full-stack Android development, demonstrating proficiency in backend development using Kotlin, database management using Room database, and cloud storage using Firebase. The source code can be found on GitHub.
